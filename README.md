## Project Overview

This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect fake Indian currency notes. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the system analyzes images of Indian currency and classifies them as authentic or counterfeit. The model is trained to learn patterns and features that differentiate real currency notes from fake ones, providing a reliable tool for identification.

## Technologies Used

### Frameworks and Libraries

  - NumPy: For numerical computations and array manipulations.

  - Keras: High-level API for building and training the CNN.

  - Pillow: For image processing and handling.

  - TensorFlow: Backend framework for implementing the neural network.

  - Flask: To create the web application interface.

  - Xception Architecture: A deep learning architecture used for feature extraction and classification.
